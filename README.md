# SparkBoxHeltec V0.53
This is a Heltec WIFI Kit 32 version of SparkBox. SparkBox is another BT pedal for the Positive Grid Spark 40.  I only needed the functionality of the simpler BT pedals. However many of them use captured hex chunks to communicate with the Spark, or were Python based. Instead I wanted to use Paul Hamshere's amazing code to create and process real messages. Also I wanted to extend the functionality a bit and make a pretty UI.

# Functions
- Expression pedal input on D34 for altering the current parameter or on/off switch
- Uses BLE so that it can be used with music function of the Spark app
- Allows connection of the app for full simultaneous control
- Switch presets either on footswitch, app or Spark to update display
- Switch on and off all four major effects dynamically
- Graphically display the effect state on the display
- Supports 4-button pedals
- Hold down any switch for 1s to switch between Effect mode and Preset mode
- Battery level indicator on UI
- BLE RSSI inidcator
